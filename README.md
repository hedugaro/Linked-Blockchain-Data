![alt tag](https://github.com/hedugaro/Linked-Blockchain-Data/blob/master/badge.png)
Linked Data is proclaimed as the Semantic Web done right. The Semantic Web is an incomplete dream so far, but a homogeneous revolutionary platform as a network of Blockchains could be the solution to this not optimal reality. This research paper introduces some initial hints and ideas about how a futuristic Internet that might be composed and powered by Blockchains networks would be constructed and designed to interconnect data and meaning, thus allow reasoning. An industrial application where Blockchain and Linked Data fits perfectly as a Supply Chain management system is also researched.
